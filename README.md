# More music!

Fullstack app built with NextJS/React, Apollo, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, and SCSS

If there's something I felt Spotify lacks, it's the ability to share thoughts and opinions of music online. There is no type of review 
or commenting system on the app, unlike Soundcloud which at least has commenting. Sometimes it's nice to see what you think of albums
and have a way of explaining your love for a certain album that doesn't require verbal explanation. This app allows you to log albums
you've listened to, give it a score, and write a review/anecdote as to why you like it--or hate it--so much.
